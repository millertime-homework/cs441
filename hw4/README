WRITEUP
-----------------------

Starting out, I saw all of the math in the description for this
assignment and got very very scared. But after realizing we've 
already done an example of this in class, I suddenly understood
exactly what I needed to do. There are several data files, and in
each one I grab the first number, it is the class of that instance
of data. In our in-class example this was "What programming language 
would you prefer that I use to show an example in class?" Then every
other value is a binary yes/no for each feature. In class our features
were "Have you been coding for more than 5 years?" and "Do you have
20/20 vision?" So far all I've gotten working is reading the data
files and counting who is in what class.
