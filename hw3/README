Simple Circuit

Goal: to prevent wires from crossing on a simple circuit.

To run the script:

For the 3 input files...
python hw3.py filename path/to/picosat

The last argument for the program is a full path to the picosat program.
You will need to make sure picosat is installed on your system. If picosat
is in your PATH, you may simply use "picosat" as the last argument.

This will produce soln-#.txt. You can check that the solution is correct
with wiring-check.hs.
