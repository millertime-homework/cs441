HOW IT WORKS
%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a Qt GUI Application that allows you to play Connect Three against a computer opponent.
Give it a few tries and you may be able to win, but by clicking "Prove 3x4" you can see that
against itself it will always tie on that size of board. It should be able to win on the 3x10
but misses some less obvious hints.

BUILDING THE EXECUTABLE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Binaries can be found on my website, http://millertime.dnsdojo.com/ConnectThree
Or if you want to download Qt and compile the source, you can do so at http://qt.nokia.com
You will need to be in the directory where the ConnectThree.pro file is:

  cd ConnectThree

And then use 'qmake' to create the Makefile.

  qmake

And finally, you can just 'make' to create the executable.

  make

It should be called ConnectThree.

  ./ConnectThree

Alternatively, you can use QtCreator to load the ConnectThree.pro file and click the green arrow
in the bottom left corner to build the executable and run it.
